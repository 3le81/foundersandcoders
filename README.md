## Founders&Coders PROJECTS

1.  [**HOBBY PAGE**](https://3le81.github.io/foundersandcoders/hobby_page/)  
    "Your first project is to create a Hobby Page.
    This can be about one of your hobbies, a particular interest of yours, or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript".  
     _Planning_: thinking of my favourite hobby and draw a small page-tester.  
     _Building_: starting from HTML basic and adding little by little an easy code.  
     _Debugging_: Testing for errors and trying to use the @media command line to resize the page.

2.  [**PROJECT PAGE**](foundersandcoders/project_page/)  
    "Build a gallery which displays the projects youâ€™ve been working on."
    _Planning_: thinking of a nice gallery page with my projects built so far.  
     _Building_: starting from HTML basic and adding little by little an easy code, using both CSS and Js.  
     _Debugging_: Testing for errors and trying to do a good and proper use of the @media command line to resize the page for different layouts.
