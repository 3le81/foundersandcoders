Founders&Coders projects
Project one: Hobby page. 
"Your first project is to create a Hobby Page. This can be about one of your hobbies, a particular interest of yours, or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript". 
Planning: thinking of my favourite hobby and draw a small page-tester.
Building: starting from HTML basic and adding little by little an easy code.
Debugging: Testing for errors and trying to use the @media command line to resize the page.
