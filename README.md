# **HOBBY PAGE**

"Your first project is to create a Hobby Page.
This can be about one of your hobbies, a particular interest of yours, or a public figure you admire. You are not required to make this about yourself or disclose anything personal. The page will be built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript".  
 _Planning_: thinking of my favourite hobby and draw a small page-tester.  
 _Building_: starting from HTML basic and adding little by little an easy code.  
 _Debugging_: Testing for errors and trying to use the @media command line to resize the page.
